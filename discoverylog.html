    <p class="p3">This page will present the various aspects of Web Foundations that I believe have been the most useful over the time I have spent over this year in practical sessions.

    <h4>Week 1</h4>
    <p class="discLogCat">Website Awards - </p>
    <p>When deciding on the award for the most useful website, I started to think about the websites that i used most frequently at the moment, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a class="hyperlink" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank">Amazon</a></li>
        <li><a class="hyperlink" href="http://www.asos.com/?hrd=1" target="_blank">Asos</a></li>
          <li><a class="hyperlink" href="https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?hl=en&ictx=2&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwin2eDh-sbSAhXHtxQKHUUyD7EQPQgD" target="_blank">Google</a></li>
            <li><a class="hyperlink" href="http://www.myport.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Portsmouth University</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>I decided that out of all of these options Amazon was the most useful because I find that when I go onto the website with a purpose of looking for a specific product or service, it almost always has the product and has it at a very reasonable price, with quick delivery. The website itself is also very easy to use with simple but effective graphics and a sensible user interface. For the most flawed website I thought about all of the websites that I had used recently which had caused me trouble or had not worked how I wanted them to. My first and final choice was due to it being a large company that I believe could have designed a more exciting website that they update regularly and think about users more often.</p>

    <h4>Week 2</h4>
    <p class="discLogCat">Web Security - </p>
    <p>This task allowed me to realise how much information I am actually generating or causing to be generated on a daily basis. After categorising this information into groups of Secret, Sensitive and Public, I could see which types of information I like to think are secure, and what types of information may not even need to be secure as they are not harmful. The task made me think about how secure my information actually was as I started to think about who could actually see my secret information and who could be using it for marketing purposes etc.</p>

  <p><i>Before:</i> Video games have been in the market for more than 30 years. They are a form of entertainment, but each game is unique. In contrast to watching a movie, video games encourage a player to be an active participant. With the changing technology, video games of today call for full concentration and participation of the player. This has its own advantages and disadvantages.</p>

Unlike films, the video game entices users to be an active participant. With improved technology, modern video games demand the user’s whole attention. This has its benefits and drawbacks. </p>

    <p>This week was focussed on links within html. The below links were inputted into my itml code using the "a" tag. I named each tag differently for simplicity e.g. “Facebook” would take them to the facebook website. The below image shows both the notepad++ document and the website.</p>

    <h4>Week 17</h4>
    <p class="discLogCat">Accessability - </p>
    <p>This week we looked at websites through the eyes of those who have visual and other impairments. This let us see the importance of making our own websites accessible in order to allow everyone, disabled or not, to be able to use the website. With the glasses, it made it very hard to see the screen clearly. This meant that larger font sizes were more useful for seeing the screen clearly and being able to use it. The gloves with the wooden sticks inside made it a lot harder to use a mouse and keyboard. Ways to counter this would be to use voice operated software so that the user could tell the computer what to do rather than having to use the mouse to interact with something.</p>
